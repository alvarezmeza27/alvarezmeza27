                    <p>
                    Hello there!
                    Miguel here. First of all, let me give you a warm welcome to my corner of the internet. This is my personal web page to show you my interest in many fields like CAD, Engineering, coffee, and many others. The goal with this space is to store information that could be useful for others people around the globe as well as enjoy while I create them.

                    My full name is Miguel Jose Alvarez (Yes, I am the person appearing in the picture). I was born a long time ago in the Colombian mountains. I become an engineer during the spring season of 2022. As you can realize surfing through this page, my interests and hobbies are related to aircraft, wind turbines, and coffee. For these first two reasons, I decided to study Aeronautical Engineering. It was the most important goal achieved during my short period of life. I did my studies at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB) located in Medell√≠n, Colombia. To give a context, UPB is one of the better universities Colombia has due to the investigation and the academic level as well. After many years to get the bachelor's label, I went to continue keeping learning about the amazing aerospace world.
