                <article>
                    <h1>Who is Miguel Alvarez?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Miguel is an Aeronautical Engineer born in a small town called Rio de Oro, in Colombia. Since he was very young, he had a fascination with airplanes due to an encyclopedia at the farm where he spent his early years. After finishing high school, Miguel received a scholarship for his excellent performance in the Colombian state exams, which allowed him to choose a career in aeronautical engineering.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                        After graduating in 2022, he began working at a Colombian startup called Simetrik, which specializes in financial transaction reconciliation for the most important banks and retailers in Latin America (a field completely unrelated to his studies). It was there that he realized one of the fastest ways to change lives is through technology and innovation.
                        At the end of 2022, he moved to London, Canada. Without neglecting his responsibilities at Simetrik, he studied Applied Aerospace Manufacturing and Aircraft Structures Technician.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                        Currently, Miguel spends his days between the world of aviation and the lines of code that enable the reconciliation of millions of transactions in the financial sector. Two fields that seem completely opposite, antipodes, but together they represent a life balance between long hours in front of a computer and building parts for those vehicles that soar through the sky. </p>

                        He doesn't like photos because he says, “The pixels and information stored in photos aren't of good enough quality to be remembered,” but on some occasions, he agrees to freeze for 3 seconds so the cameras can capture him. That's why, although few, here you can find some of them.  </p>
