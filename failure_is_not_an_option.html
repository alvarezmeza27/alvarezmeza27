                    <h1>Review: Failure is not an Option by Gene Kranz</h1>
                    <p>Failure is not an Option written by Gene Kranz speaks about three NASA programs: Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.</p>
                    <p>(Photo credits: NASA). Failure is not an option is a book written by Gene Kranz. It was the first book I have read in English. As my background, I have a vulnerability when rockets and aircraft appear on my eyes and the pages I am following, I love these little toys and the behind physics embedded. This book is really good. Kranz can combine a good story with the rigorous relate with the important role he and his team had played on the human history. The book speaks about the development of the American space program, being there the programs Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. The cornerstone of this book is to understand why and how they were successful with all their missions and programs.
                        <h2>Mercury Program. (1964)</h2>
                        The Mercury program used two booster rockets; the Redstone and the Atlas. The Redstone was an Army battlefield rocket. The Atlas was an Air Force intercontinental missile and was to be used for both ballistic and orbital Mercury missions. 
                    The early space hardware had much in common with the imaginary technology in a Jules Verne science fiction novel. The capsule used steam-powered thrusters for control (the steam being generated by the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst in a nickel chamber attached to the thrusters), a periscope for visual tracking, and an electric Earth globe for determining position. 
	                <h3>Freedom 7</h3> 
                    This was the first mission in which the States got into the space the first American. Allan Shepard was the first American to cross this imaginary line that divide the earth from space. being that 400 km over earth surface. The rocket used was the Redstone-Atlas. Don’t forget that the Soviet Union put the first human in orbit a couple of weeks before, being Yuri Gagarin the first human to be go and back from the dark space. 
                    Gemini Program. 
                    This program was, in general, a trainer for the astronauts and the ground control mission for the next, and biggest, Apollo program and lunar landing. It was a mission sending two astronauts per mission.
                    <h2>Apollo Program (1968 - Apollo 7)</h2>
	                <h3>Apollo 11</h3> It was the Apollo mission that put humans on the moon's surface. One of the most interesting parts of the book is to read how Gene explains that, due to the training made days before the real mission, they were capable to resolve a problem that appeared during the final stage of the moon landing; the 1202 alarm. This error was caused because the computer was overloaded.
	                <h3>Apollo 12</h3> This mission was struck with lightning during the lift-off, but the mission was successful. 
	                <h3>Apollo 13</h3>This was the mission of the disaster. An oxygen tank exploded during the mission causing hard moments for both the crew and ground control. From this mission comes the popular phrase "Huston, we have a problem". Hopefully, the crew came back to earth. However, it was a tought mission for the astronauts.
                    <h2>Speaking about the Artemis Program</h2>
                    Is well know that the Artemis NASA program is the way that the United Stated is trying to reach the moon again. This program will use the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket to take again our satellite. But, it´s hard to see how all the advantages made during the Apollo era were thrown to the garbage.
                    
                    <h3>Phrases extracted from the book</h3>
                    <li><em>"Because they really wanted to send a dog, but they decided that would be too cruel</em></li> 
                    <li><em>Gemini was one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac, the sign of the twins…. A perfect label for a spacecraft flying a two-man crew</em></li>
                    <li><em>After the mission we reconstructed McDevitt’s maneuvers. Following separation he was ahead of the booster in orbit and as he thrust toward the booster e was performing a retrograde (slowdown) maneuver. As the spacecraft slowed down it went into a lower orbit. To balance the force of gravity, a spacecraft in a lower orbit must travel faster than one in a higher orbit, This, by slowing down McDevitt was descending and going faster pulling away from the booster´s orbit</em> </li>
                    <li><em>To ensure that they were easy to find, I used pictures of various striking young women from the Sport Illustrated Swimsuit Edition for all my book covers.</em></li>
                   <li><em>Alarm 1201. THIS WAS NOT AN ABORT. YOU SOULD HAVE COUNTINUED THE LANDING.</em></li>   
                    <li><em>I am a dreamer, believing that the mark of a champion is the ability to thrive in tough times.</em></li>
